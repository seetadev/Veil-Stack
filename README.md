## **Veil Stack**

**A Confidential, Decentralized Container Orchestration Layer Powered by FHE**

**Veil Stack** is a **privacy-preserving, decentralized container orchestration platform** that enables organizations and distributed compute networks to securely schedule and manage containerized workloads **without exposing sensitive operational data**. Built on **libp2p** for peer-to-peer coordination and anchored by an **Ethereum smart contract** for shared state and governance, Veil Stack introduces **Zama’s Universal Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) SDK** to enable **encrypted cluster telemetry, scheduling decisions, and policy enforcement**.

In Veil Stack, cluster nodes never need to reveal their resource utilization metrics, performance data, or workload profiles. Instead, orchestration logic operates directly on **encrypted inputs**, ensuring that:

* **Resource data remains confidential**
* **Scheduling decisions remain optimal**
* **No cluster member gains insight into another’s infrastructure**
* **The orchestration layer is trustless and verifiable**

This makes Veil Stack the first orchestration system capable of operating in **zero-trust distributed compute environments**, where nodes may be owned by different organizations, providers, or decentralized network participants.

### **Why Veil Stack Matters**

Conventional orchestrators (Kubernetes, Nomad, DC/OS) require centralized control and **full visibility** into all cluster internals. This creates risks:

* Sensitive performance or topology data can leak.
* Cross-institutional collaboration becomes impossible without trust.
* Operators are forced to centralize their infrastructure and governance.

Veil Stack removes that trust bottleneck.

By combining:

| Component                   | Responsibility                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **libp2p**                  | Peer discovery, messaging, cluster health gossip (SWIM)                             |
| **Ethereum smart contract** | State anchoring, membership registry, governance & cluster metadata                 |
| **Zama Universal FHE SDK**  | Encrypted scheduling, encrypted decision functions, confidential policy enforcement |

Veil Stack turns container orchestration into a **trust-minimized protocol**, not a centralized control plane.

### **Key Capabilities**

| Capability                                | Description                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encrypted Resource Scheduling**         | Nodes share encrypted utilization and performance signals; scheduling runs entirely on ciphertext. |
| **Zero-Trust Cluster Federation**         | Multiple organizations can operate as one cluster without exposing internal infrastructure.        |
| **Decentralized Control Plane**           | No single point of failure; operations continue even if nodes drop offline.                        |
| **Confidential Replication & Redundancy** | Workloads can be mirrored across nodes without revealing topology or load patterns.                |

### **Example Use Cases**

* **Healthcare compute cooperatives** where patient-data-derived workloads require strict confidentiality
* **Cross-cloud ML training clusters** where cloud providers should not see competitor data
* **Decentralized cloud and edge compute networks** where participants are semi-trusted or anonymous
* **Governmental or defense computing environments** requiring operational secrecy

---

### **Outcome**

Veil Stack creates the foundation for the **Confidential Decentralized Cloud** — where compute is:

* Peer-to-peer
* Verifiable
* Always available
* And **encrypted end-to-end**
